# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines
- Follow Unix philosophy: build small, composable functions where higher-level methods leverage lower-level primitives. Don't mix concerns (e.g., don't embed identifier resolution inside a SCIM CRUD method). Keep signatures consistent across sibling methods.
